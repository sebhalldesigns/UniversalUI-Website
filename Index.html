        <h1>Overview</h1>

        UniversalUI is a clean-slate approach to application development. 
        Making use of low-level technologies and using minimal abstraction, it delivers high performance with low complexity. 

        <br> <br>
        Here are some highlights of UniversalUI's capabilities:

        <h3>Lightweight</h3>

        UniversalUI applications are extrememly lightweight and portable. As an example, a zero-dependency Windows application
        currently sits under 1MB, and this includes everything from the application code to the rendering and layout systems.
        
        <h3>Consistent</h3>

        Making use of the CMake build system, UniversalUI applications are perfectly consistent between platforms. Zero changes
        to source code are required for porting a UniversalUI project designed for iOS to Windows or any other platform.

        <h3>Powerful</h3>

        Due to the integral use of GPUs and rendering, UniversalUI provides an easy-to-use platform to build applications with
        demanding rendering or effects.

        <h3>Portable</h3>

        Apps built with UniversalUI are completely self-contained so can be easily transferred between devices, without requiring extensive install processes.
